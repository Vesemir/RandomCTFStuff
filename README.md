Just another solution for GoogleCtf's MicroServiceDaemonOS. Used 'shellcode' is in '*.asm', some self-explanatory layout is in '*.png', auto-solver in '*.py' (may occasionally fail since byte generation is random, but it worked the first time it was finished). Also the task binary is included for completeness ('*.txt' * '*.'(elf64) if someone wants to look at it when it's deleted).
